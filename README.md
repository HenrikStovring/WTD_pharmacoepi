Introduction to the Waiting Time Distribution and its applications in pharmacoepidemiology

Most pharmacoepidemiological studies of drug utilization or effects of drug use requires determination of dispensing durations, i.e. the time after a filled prescription in which a patient can be considered treated with the medication. The Waiting Time Distribution has been developed to provide estimates of these durations. In its parametric versions it provides estimates based on maximum likelihood, which ensures that estimates are generally unbiased (in the statistical sense), are statistically efficient and have valid standard errors, when the model is correctly specified. 

This repository is intended to provide a list of key papers on the development of the method and examples of its application. Currently the method has been implemented in Stata and an R-package is under active development.
